Welcome to my personal repository! I'm Hanna I'm 25, currently studying MSc in Medialogy at Aalborg University. For my bachelor's I studied an AP degree in Multimedia Design, then a top up in Design, Business and Technology. I later specialised in Film editing and Cinematography, working at the production company Blonde Inc. for three years. I'm passionate about the merge between media and technology and want to be in the driving force of creating ceptivating visuals using technology like Unreal Engine 5 for a variety of platforms and devices including VR environments. This direction is fluid, and might change - so stay tuned! Also I'm currently sitting in my Machine learning class with some fine folks. Thanks for making it a cosy start Cumhur and Mubarik!

Good bye!

Salam Alaikum!
